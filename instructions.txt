I've already created a basic nextjs application. In the ‘app/page.tsx’ file, I want you to create the following elements: 

1. A list of 500 foods, for each food (for example: potato, onion, rice) we'll have all the nutritional information for that food per 100 grams.
2. The user will have a search field where they can type in a food, the food will appear and the user will be able to validate the food.
3. Once the food has been validated, a text such as ‘Food selected: onion’ will appear. If no food has been selected, add the text ‘You must search for a food using the search bar above’.
4. If the user has validated a food, they must then indicate the weight of this food, for example 84 grams, using an input field.
5. Then, depending on the food and the weight, display all the nutritional information for that food (calories, proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, minerals, etc.).
